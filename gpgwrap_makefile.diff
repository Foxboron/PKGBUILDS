Subject: [PATCH] fixes/gpgwrap_makefile

This allows the main Makefile not to fail when trying to install gpgwrap.
It just adds the install target in the gpgwrap Makefile.

That could be avoided by handling differently the gpgwrap project in the main
Makefile, but then it is going to be the mess.

The new target does not install anything since so far the man page is currently
installed from debian/rules, and thus everything to install gpgwrap is added to
debian.rules for consistency purpose.
